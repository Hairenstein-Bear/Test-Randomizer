# Test-Randomizer
Used to randomize samples in pharmaceutical compounding

I worked with a client who needed a way to truly randomize his testing that he does during pharmaceutical compounding.  I coded this in VsCode and it uses 
JavaScript code to create an amount of random numbers based on how many tests are being performed and highlights those particular sections. On the next
iteration of the project I am going to make the grid customizable so the amount of potential tests can be changed or the orientation of the test samples can
be adjusted to allow for more universal app usage.
